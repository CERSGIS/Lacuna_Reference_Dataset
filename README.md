# LACUNA REFERENCE DATASET
This repository hosts reference datasets developed by CERSGIS with support from the Lacuna Fund, GIZ, WRI, and other local partners. This was necessary to address critical gaps in monitoring deforestation drivers like cocoa farming and illegal gold mining (Galamsey) across six (6) regions in Ghana (Ashanti, Ahafo, Central, Eastern, Western, Western North).

### The dataset combines:
- 20,035 reference point samples for Galamsey, oil palm, rubber, and open/degraded forest, collected for land use and land cover mapping in Ghanaâ€™s cocoa-forest mosaic regions.
- 21,141 reference cocoa farm polygons with detailed attributes (e.g., shade trees, farm size).
- 14,331 homogenous reference cocoa farm polygons with detailed attributes.
- 4,444 anonymized socioeconomic surveys.

## Key Features
- Ground-truthed data: Collected and mapped via field campaigns using the Open Foris Ground Mobile App and high-resolution Planet imagery analysis in Collect Earth Online.
- Machine learning-ready: Structured for training LULC classification models to distinguish cocoa from other tree crops (e.g., oil palm, rubber).

## Methodology
1. Satellite pre-screening: Identified uncertain areas for field validation
1. Field campaigns: Polygons digitized using Open Foris Ground; attributes collected via farmer interviews.
1. QA/QC: Topology checks, expert review, and cross-validation with historical imagery.
